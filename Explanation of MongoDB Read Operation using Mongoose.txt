Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It allows developers to work with MongoDB using JavaScript objects. 

To read data from MongoDB, Mongoose provides various methods: 

 .find() → Retrieves multiple documents that match a query. If no query is passed, it returns all documents. 
 .findById() → Retrieves a single document using the _id field. It returns null if no document matches. 

These methods return Promises, which we handle using async/await and wrap in try-catch blocks to manage errors gracefully.
